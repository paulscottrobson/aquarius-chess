BREAKOUT

When the first games were released the most popular game was "Tele-Tennis", which now in 1984 seems to be like something out of Stonehenge.<br>
   Breakout is the new all machine code game, which has turned tennis into the futuristic plasma gun of the nineties.<br>
   The earths ionosphere has been replaced by layers of polluted atomic dust placed by the planet Ugh, which is even now bombarding the earth with, "Goodness, Gracious Me", great balls of fire.<br>
   You, Professor Reflector, have developed the "Reflector Reverser", which if placed in line with the balls of fire, reverses them and reflects them back into the layers of atomic dust. Direct hits by the "Reverser" knock great big holes in the layers, allowing sunlight to come in and the earth to be saved. 10 times you usethe reflector and you are wiping the skys clean, because once you have broken through the bottom layers, the reflector reflects and reverses within the layers knocking them out. . . and then. . . planet ugh strikes back with a complety new set of layers of atomic dust and. . . this slimy polluted layer of horrors has a mind of its own and is advancing down onto the earth's crust and particularly down onto you, Professor Reflector, to wipe out the "Reflector Reverser". You have 10 balls of fire coming towards you, which you must reflect and revers to save the earth!
