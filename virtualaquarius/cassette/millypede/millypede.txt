Millypede
Aquarius & 16K Extension

Millypede

After the Inter-Galactic fusion bomb hit Earth, strange things happened to our plant and animal life (and spelling!).  The once humble mushroom patch is now inhabited by some of the most deadly mutants, millypedes.  It is up to you to activate the anti-mutant weapons.

Your task is to prevent the mutant millypedes and sickly spiders getting into your family anti-fusion shelter.  But be careful there's more danger lurking.  Once you've killed the first mutant-millypedes, they mutate and turn into multi-mutant millypedes (wow alliteration).

Just how good are you at playing this all machine language code version of the oldie arcade game.  Play millypede and find out.  This is the version of the arcade game that's challenging even the Time Lords.  But if you're one of the high scorers senid it in and go into our hall of fame.
