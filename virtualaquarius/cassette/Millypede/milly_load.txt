
Tips on loading the program using an Aquarius computer
------------------------------------------------------
Millypede comes in two parts, a BASIC program (MILLY_BAS_Q.WAV) which
is loaded first, followed by the ML program (MILLY_A_Q.WAV). A 16K RAM 
memory expansion cartridge is also needed.


Here are a couple methods to try:   

1. Hook up the Aquarius to your PC's sound card:
The Aquarius cassette cable input jack is hooked up directly to the 
sound card's output, using about $7 worth of adaptors from the local 
stereo supply store.  The WAV files are then played using Creative 
Wave Studio or GOLDWAVE (www.goldwave.com). Windows Media player 
does not work.  You can read about hooking up your system here:

(just search the page for "goldwave")


2. Transfer the files directly to a cassette tape:
(This is theoretical as it hasn't been tested yet)
- hook a cassette recorder to the PC soundcard output/speaker port.
- play the WAV files on the PC and record it on a cassette. The 2
  Millypede files need to be in the proper order, with a small gap
  in between.
- use that cassette with an Aquarius Data recorder and follow the
  instructions listed below to load and play the game.


Loading instructions (from the original documentation)

(2) Start the data recorder and press  "RTN" again.

(3) When "OK" appears on the TV stop the tape.

(4) Hold down the "CTL" key and press ''l ", then press "RTN", start
    the data recorder and press " RTN " again.

(5) The machine code will now load into your computer, once this has
    loaded the programme will self run.

(6) Don't forget to stop and rewind the tape.
