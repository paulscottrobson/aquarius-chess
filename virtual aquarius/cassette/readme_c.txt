These .CAQ files are Aquarius-format cassette files.

To use them, type CLOAD on the Aquarius, and press RETURN when prompted to do so.

From the File menu, select Play Cassette File, and choose the .CAQ file you want.


Some of the games are from the Radofin demo tape.  These come in two parts, a BASIC program and an ML program.  To load one of these, say, STALAC, follow the procedure above.  Then RUN the program.  It will prompt you to press RETURN.  Do so, then select Play Cassette File from the File menu.  This time, choose the corresponding _A.CAQ file, in this example, select STALAC_A.CAQ.

Note also that some of the games require the 16K RAM expander.


Window is a program I (James) wrote myself.  It is a program for exploring the memory of the Aquarius home computer.  It displays two pages of memory.  Use the = and - keys to move forward and backward in memory.  Use the h,j,k,l keys to move a little memory cursor around.  Use the p key, followed by three decimal digits, to poke a byte at the cursor's location.  Use the q key to quit.  Enjoy.  You can see that I used a trick to put the data for the ML subroutine into the program, which is why this program can't be Quicktyped.

=====
Please note that the Aquarius tape file format has no checksums or quality-of-data checks, so these transfers may not be faithful to the authors' original works.
One way to check would be to redundantly make a transfer of an independent copy.  Unfortunately, Aquarius cassette software is very rare, and obtaining multiple copies of a particular tape is difficult, not to mention expensive.
You can help, of course -- if you own Aquarius tapes, do your own independent transfers, and compare the resultant CAQ files with what you find here.  Let me know the results, positive or negative.

	Transferred by me
	Note: functionally identical to a transfer by M -- 
	my transfer appears to have 16 more nulls at the end, and
	the BASIC array is appropriately DIMmed 4 elements larger.
	My transfer is the version included here.
	Also note that this is not the same game as the GamesPack4 game.
