 
Advanced D&D Treasure of Tarmin. Only Mattel title with picture on title screen. 

BurgerTime
The special chef color effects are altered in emulation.  He is supposed to just have a peachy face, not the whole background of his hat.

MarqueeDemo 
An extremely rare ROM. This was used as an in-store demo to show off the AQ's "impressive" abilites.

MelodyChase 
A rare title. Only Mattel game with music title screen and attract mode.  

QuickDisk
Here is a real rare gem. Of course, we need emulated drive support. (Ahem, James) 

Shark! 
Here is the prototype in all of its glory! Too bad the shark wasn't implemented yet. :( 

SpaceSpeller 
Another rare title. I think we all can still learn from this invaluable edutainment title.
