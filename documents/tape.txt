Cassette Interface
==================

$1BCE READSYNC ($EDF0)

Skips over the sync header ($FF), and the following $00 byte.

By changing this so it skips any immediately preceding $00 bytes we can chain together CAQ files.

$1B4D READCASSETTEBYTE ($EDF1)

Read 1 byte into A. Z flag set. 


CLOAD should load a directory ? like on C64/PET

$1CD9 Skips sync reads 6 bytes.

CQC files are concatenated CAQ files - literally.
